//! Live session attach: the ephemeral per-agent frame fan-out behind doc_3426 ask 7 (task_1462).
//!
//! An attacher reads a running agent's live transcript + thought-process frames; the headless
//! harness pushes those frames to the board while at least one attacher is present. The frames are
//! EPHEMERAL and best-effort: they fan out over an in-process per-agent `broadcast` channel and are
//! never persisted. The durable recovery substrate is the `transcript_chunks` log (task_1463), a
//! separate concern -- an attacher that misses frames re-pulls that log to fill the gap.
//!
//! Backpressure invariant: a slow or disconnected attacher never applies backpressure to the
//! agent's turn loop or to other attachers. The broadcast ring drops the oldest buffered frames for
//! a lagging receiver and surfaces the drop as a `RecvError::Lagged(n)`, which the attach stream
//! turns into a gap marker so the attacher knows the dropped `frame_seq` range to re-pull.
//!
//! Durability split: only the attach-state transitions (first-attach / last-detach) and the
//! steer/abort control items are durable, delivered to the harness as events on the existing
//! emit + inbox + push path (see `core::{attach_session, detach_session, steer_session,
//! abort_session}`). This module holds just the in-memory frame bus; the authoritative
//! reference count that decides push-on / push-off lives in the durable `session_attachments`
//! table, not in this bus's live receiver count.
